Amazon says it takes issue with the settings of the Face ID during the test and that 95% or higher is the search threshold for law enforcement activities.

Update with an AWS spokesperson's statement to Seeking Alpha:
""We have seen customers use the image and video analysis capabilities of Amazon Rekognition in ways that materially benefit both society (e.g. preventing human trafficking, inhibiting child exploitation, reuniting missing children with their families, and building educational apps for children), and organizations (enhancing security through multi-factor authentication, finding images more easily, or preventing package theft). We remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world, including in the public sector and law enforcement.""
""With regard to this recent test of Amazon Rekognition by the ACLU, we think that the results could probably be improved by following best practices around setting the confidence thresholds (this is the percentage likelihood that Rekognition found a match) used in the test. While 80% confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs, chairs, animals, or other social media use cases, it wouldn’t be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty. When using facial recognition for law enforcement activities, we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95% or higher.""
""Finally, it is worth noting that in real world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgement (and not to make fully autonomous decisions), where it can help find lost children, restrict human trafficking, or prevent crimes.”

Trump slammed the Postal Service late last year for undercharging Amazon for deliveries, which he claimed cost the service money. The Postal Service’s FY17 results had revenue down $1.8B on the year due to declines in First-Class and Marketing Mail, partially offset by a growth in package volume.
Last month’s Supreme Court ruling pertaining to online sales taxes actually benefitted Amazon. The company already collected sales tax on the product it sells directly and the ruling didn’t specify how third-party sales should be taxed. 
Second tweet: “….In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?” 
The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos’ holding company Nash Holdings, not Amazon itself.

Nathanson says Amazon Prime Video’s growth could prove slow if Amazon tries to build marketing while producing its own shows. 
CBS is currently in the middle of a court battle between National Amusements’ Shari Redstone and CBS CEO Les Moonves. An October 3 court date could decide the control of the company. 
Nathanson does doubt that CBS will be “given their freedom from NAI’s control” but says “an M&A premium would quickly emerge” if it did happen.
