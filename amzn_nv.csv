Either route the company pursues will be expensive. The original AmazonGo cashierless store in downtown Seattle needed $1M in hardware alone to enable the sensors to allow people to scan in on entry and simply walk out with what they wanted.
But sticking to prepared foods rather than groceries would require fewer cameras and sensors, and those goods have a wider profit margin than groceries do.

Update with an AWS spokesperson's statement to Seeking Alpha:
""We have seen customers use the image and video analysis capabilities of Amazon Rekognition in ways that materially benefit both society (e.g. preventing human trafficking, inhibiting child exploitation, reuniting missing children with their families, and building educational apps for children), and organizations (enhancing security through multi-factor authentication, finding images more easily, or preventing package theft). We remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world, including in the public sector and law enforcement.""
""With regard to this recent test of Amazon Rekognition by the ACLU, we think that the results could probably be improved by following best practices around setting the confidence thresholds (this is the percentage likelihood that Rekognition found a match) used in the test. While 80% confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs, chairs, animals, or other social media use cases, it wouldnât be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty. When using facial recognition for law enforcement activities, we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95% or higher.""
""Finally, it is worth noting that in real world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgement (and not to make fully autonomous decisions), where it can help find lost children, restrict human trafficking, or prevent crimes.â

Prime Day is an even bigger international event this year. New nations added to the mix include Australia, Singapore, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
The Prime Day event last year was a retail sector disrupter, with sales up 60% on a year-over-year comparison.
This year, Amazon is promising select deals at all U.S. Whole Foods stores in another grocery challenge to Kroger (NYSE:KR), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The company is levering its Amazon Prime Rewards Visa program, with a 10% back offer on purchases of up to $400 at Whole Foods.
Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods 13 months ago created shockwaves in the retail sector, although some of the most dire forecasts on pricing and market share haven't been realized.

First announced last fall, Amazon calls the IPI a âfirst step in setting a barâ for inventory performance by tracking how well merchants shift products that arenât selling and readjust listings. 
Beginning Sunday, inventory that sits in Amazon warehouses for too long without shipping to customers or back to the merchant will hurt the seller IPI. 
A score lower than 350 (on a 0 to 1,000 scale) means a merchant canât send more products to the warehouses. Amazon will also charge a monthly âoverage feeâ on inventory exceeding storage limits. 
Sellers could previously rent unlimited space regardless of inventory management practices.
