The big banks say that starting another payment system could slow progress and interoperability between the two rapid payment systems would be a concern.

Either route the company pursues will be expensive. The original AmazonGo cashierless store in downtown Seattle needed $1M in hardware alone to enable the sensors to allow people to scan in on entry and simply walk out with what they wanted.
But sticking to prepared foods rather than groceries would require fewer cameras and sensors, and those goods have a wider profit margin than groceries do.

Update with an AWS spokesperson's statement to Seeking Alpha:
""We have seen customers use the image and video analysis capabilities of Amazon Rekognition in ways that materially benefit both society (e.g. preventing human trafficking, inhibiting child exploitation, reuniting missing children with their families, and building educational apps for children), and organizations (enhancing security through multi-factor authentication, finding images more easily, or preventing package theft). We remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world, including in the public sector and law enforcement.""
""With regard to this recent test of Amazon Rekognition by the ACLU, we think that the results could probably be improved by following best practices around setting the confidence thresholds (this is the percentage likelihood that Rekognition found a match) used in the test. While 80% confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs, chairs, animals, or other social media use cases, it wouldn’t be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty. When using facial recognition for law enforcement activities, we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95% or higher.""
""Finally, it is worth noting that in real world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgement (and not to make fully autonomous decisions), where it can help find lost children, restrict human trafficking, or prevent crimes.”

Trump slammed the Postal Service late last year for undercharging Amazon for deliveries, which he claimed cost the service money. The Postal Service’s FY17 results had revenue down $1.8B on the year due to declines in First-Class and Marketing Mail, partially offset by a growth in package volume.
